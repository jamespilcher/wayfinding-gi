## Overview

This Unity project is intended to be a tool for conducting wayfinding studies, with extinsibility in mind for future studies and parameter tweaks.

This project includes an implementation of the Dual Solution Paradigm (DSP), a framework commonly used in wayfinding studies to analyze how individuals navigate and find their way in different environments. Please see [Running a DSP Study](RunningADSPStudy.md) for more info.

## Features

- Stat collection for individual trials and studies as a whole
- Extensibility for other studies and parameter tweaking.

## Set up

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jamespilcher/wayfinding-study-tool
    ```
2. Open the project in `Unity 2022.3.30f1` or later.
