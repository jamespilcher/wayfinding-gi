## Overview

This Unity project is intended to be a tool for conducting wayfinding studies, with extinsibility in mind for future studies and parameter tweaks. Such a tool was previously not available online.

This project includes an implementation of the Dual Solution Paradigm (DSP), a framework commonly used in wayfinding studies to analyze how individuals navigate and find their way in different environments. Please see [Running a DSP Study](RunningADSPStudy.md) for more info.

## Features
- A fully working and usuable Dual Solution Paradigm Study implementation
- Stat collection for individual trials and studies as a whole
- An extensible codebase, in which new parameters and logic can be added in a modern and stable unity version.
- Generally, a framework from which future wayfinding studies can be ran from.

## Set up
1. [Install Unity ](https://unity.com/download)
2. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jamespilcher/wayfinding-study-tool
    ```
3. Open the project in `Unity 2022.3.30f1` or later.

## Feature Requests and Issues

Feature requests should be raised as an [Issue](https://github.com/jamespilcher/wayfinding-study-tool/issues) and contain relevant on what needs to be added.

Unsurprisingly, issues should also be raised as an Issue.
